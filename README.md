Build Websites With Ketrew
==========================

This script uses Ketrew to build the documentation of a bunch of projects.

Type-check:

    ocaml build_all_docs.ml

Run:

    ocaml build_all_docs.ml go

For now this works with the `dev` branch of Ketrew, which should be running as
a server on <https://localhost:8443> and accept `netok` as authentication
token.
